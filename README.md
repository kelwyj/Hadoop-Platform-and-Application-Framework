This class is 1 of 6 offered by UC San Diego for their Big Data Specialization certificate on Coursera. The course covers Hadoop architecture, software stack, and execution environment, walking through hands-on examples of the Hadoop and Spark frameworks.
This course is for novice programmers or business people who would like to understand the core tools used to wrangle and analyze big data. With no prior experience, you will have the opportunity to walk through hands-on examples with Hadoop and Spark frameworks, two of the most common in the industry. You will be comfortable explaining the specific components and basic processes of the Hadoop architecture, software stack, and execution environment.   In the assignments you will be guided in how data scientists apply the important concepts and techniques such as Map-Reduce that are used to solve fundamental problems in big data.  You'll feel empowered to have conversations about big data and the data analysis process.

In Week 4 of the course, we discuss the Map/Reduce framework with two exercises in Hadoop streaming using Python:
